# Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Peer Benchmark Module
According to [The Institute of Education Sciences](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/DFR/2021/ReportHTML.aspx?unitid=107460), the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is a system of survey components that collects data from all institutions that provide postsecondary education and are eligible to receive Title IV funding across the United States and other U.S. jurisdictions.

These data are used at the federal and state level for policy analysis and development; at the institutional level for benchmarking and peer analysis; and by students and parents, through the [College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/), an online tool to aid in the college search process. Additional information about IPEDS can be found on [the website](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds).


## Problem Statement
Higher education institutions are surrounded by data. In a relatively short time period, higher education has transitioned from institutions with limited data availability to ones with an abundance of data at the tips of their fingers. What has not changed is the need to translate data into meaningful information. The seminal challenge today, given the abundance of data everywhere, is identifying and unearthing the most important data in order to answer key questions. At the foundational level, the IPEDS solution will provide institutions with the ability to bring key data points to the forefront. Specifically allowing institutions to leverage nationally available data to inform, provide contextual understanding, and enhance the ability of institutions to gain key insights from their historically reported data and allow them to benchmark themselves against selected peer institutions. 


## Module Impact
The purpose of this solution is to share techniques for leveraging meaningful data on publicly available data for dissemination to key university stakeholders (Board of Trustees, faculty, administers, students, and staff). The primary foci of the presentation will be to: 
1) leverage the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data through data visualization to provide longitudinal analysis of undergraduate and graduate enrollment, tuition, post-graduate outcomes for recent graduates.
2) determine if there are patterns across benchmarked data with selected feeder institutions.  Findings will inform key university stakeholders key institutional data patterns, such as enrollment, retention and graduation outcomes of recent graduates, and potential demand for institutional programs.

This solution will provide insight into how Higher Education can utilize Microsoft Power BI to leverage national and institutional enrollment, admission, outcomes, academic affairs, and budget data to develop a data-informed culture that leverages data for data-informed decision-making.  Participants will gain first-hand knowledge on how to leverage national and institutional data to allow internal and external stakeholders to have a shared understanding of key longitudinal metrics.  Presenters will demonstrate national and institutional level aid dashboards and discuss potential uses for each.

## Module Setup and Data Sources
The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is the National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) core postsecondary education data collection program. IPEDS provides institution level data of postsecondary education in the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) and other jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Data source for this module is an Excel sheet.

## Module Components 
Sample out-of-the box assets for this OEA module include:
