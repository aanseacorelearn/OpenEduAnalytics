This view provides a visually guided framework for how key stakeholders at every level of the institution can engage in a meaning conversation of data trends related to key strategic areas.  The most currently available eight years of IPEDS data are shown for each metric. 
- Applicants, Admitted, Enrolled: applicants, admits, and enrollment by year
- First Time in College Enrollment: first-time, full-time enrollment by year
- Published in-state tuition & fees: published in-state tuition and fees by year
- Avg. institutional grant aid to FTFT undergrads: average institutional grant aid to first-time, full-time undergraduates by year
- Undergraduate and Graduate Enrollment: enrollment (undergraduate and graduate) by year
- Net Revenue per FTE: net revenue per full-time equivalent by year
- Full-time Retention Rate: first-time, full-time retention rate by year
- Graduation rate - Bachelor degree attainment:four-year and six-year graduation rates by year
