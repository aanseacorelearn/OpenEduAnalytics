# Microsoft School Transformation Survey
As part of Microsoft’s commitment to empower every educator to do more, we have created the new [School Transformation Survey (STS)](https://github.com/MicrosoftEduIndustry/sts) to help schools begin their education transformation and to measure their progress.

The [School Transformation Survey](https://github.com/MicrosoftEduIndustry/sts) is a free, self hosted survey that measures the perceptions of educators and leaders on the current state of innovative teaching practices in their schools or classrooms. It is a self-review and serves as an important first step in raising awareness of each school’s current state of transformation.

Data from the School Transformation Survey can be added to an OEA Azure data lake and used in analytics as part of use cases where school and pedagogy data would be of value.

The report presents the results of surveys of leaders and educators. The survey measures participants’ perception of innovative teaching practices in the school, 
including how digital technologies are used in learning and school support for innovative practices. The goal of the survey is to provide tools for schools 
to measure and develop innovative teaching and learning, and to ultimately better prepare students for life and work in the 21st century. 
This survey is based on a broader multinational study called Innovative Teaching and Learning (ITL) Research.

This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftEduIndustry/sts) provides guidance on how to deploy the School Transformation Survey.
