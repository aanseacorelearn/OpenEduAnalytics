# Notebook
This module incorporates 2 notebooks needed to support the main [module pipeline](link to module pipeline). Both notebooks depend on the [OEA Python class](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/framework/synapse/notebook/OEA_py.ipynb) which is a part of the [OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/framework).

## Module Python Class Notebook: [Insert name of notebook with hyperlink]
The module Python class notebook that defines the data schemas and pseudonymization. Basic functions for data ingestion and processing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 data lakes are also included. 

[Note: This notebook should be commented for clarity of function ingestion and processing.]

## Module Data Ingestion Notebook: [Insert name of notebook with hyperlink]
Module data ingestion notebook which depends on the module class. The pipeline template incorporates this notebook, and is automatically uploaded upon importing the [name of module] module pipeline template.

Attach to your configured Spark pool and run. This editable notebook is written in PySpark [edit if you used a different programming language] and covers the general use cases of the [name of module].
