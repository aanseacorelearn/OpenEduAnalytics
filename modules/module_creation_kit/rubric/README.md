# Quality Rubric
Modules contributed to OEA are categorized in 3 levels: [Basic](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_creation_kit/rubric/basic.md), [Approved](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_creation_kit/rubric/approved.md) and [Advanced](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/module_creation_kit/rubric/advanced.md). 

The benchmark for OEA module creation is the [Microsoft Education Insights module](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/modules/module_catalog/Microsoft_Education_Insights), which meets the requirements for the ‘Advanced’ level. This module can be used as a guideline for creating and submitting a new OEA module.

Check the boxes associated with the requirement of each level to keep track of your progress. To check the box, place an x within the square bracket and save/commit.

Example: 
- [x] Place an x within the square bracket [] to mark an item as complete. N.B: To render properly, there shouldn't be any extra space within the square bracket.
