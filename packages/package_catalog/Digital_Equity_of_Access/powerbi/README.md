# Power BI Dashboards

The OEA Digital Learning Insights Package includes example Power BI dashboards which were developed in collaboration with key stakeholders at [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/) in Fresno, California. The aim of these dashboards is to:
  - give a district [overview of digital equity and no signals](#equity-of-digital-access), and
  - provide an [overview of low signals across the district summarized by ISP](#landscape-of-digital-access).
  
These dashboards are examples and were developed in discussion with the [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/)  (see [Use Case Document](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Digital_Equity_of_Access/docs/OEA%20Digital%20Learning%20Package%20-%20Access%20Use%20Case.pdf) for details). To prepare a data model for building your own dashboards, follow the [Package Setup Instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/main/packages/package_catalog/Digital_Equity_of_Access#package-setup-instructions).
